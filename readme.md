# not meant for external use (unless you take everyday the exact same busline as I do)
This is a simple CLI that displays when the next bus on the line I usually take will arrive.
Because the bus company from my city doesn't offer an API, this script scrapes the time of the arrival of the next buses from their website.

I might tweak it one day to make it work for any busline, but it seems like a waste of time considering the lack of public API available could potentialy bring breaking changes from their part
